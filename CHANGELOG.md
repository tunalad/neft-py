# NeFT (1.1.0)

Bumping to 1.1.0 because Subcommands aren't a small change to this program!

## Added

-   Subcommands for adding, removing and renaming template files
-   `--version` option
-   Made `sort`, `reverse` & `use_gdg_path` options take priority over the config file when passed

## Fixed

-   Duplicate items not showing their file icon
-   Made `--help` message a bit cleaner

## Removed

-   `VERSION` file

---

# NeFT (1.0.1)

Note that I have accidentally set the version to 1.0.2 in the `VERSION` file.

## Fixed

-   Selecting file with the same name would always select from the first template directory we specified in config
-   Even when we set `icons` to false, we would still get the icons

---

# NeFT (1.0.0)

Initial stable version!
Consider this a warning: I'm super awful with versioning my programs.
